# AI & ML Demos Workshop

Welcome! This project hosts simple, interactive machine learning demos and notebooks for educational workshops. The goal is to provide easy-to-understand examples that anyone can run and explore.

## Viewing the Demos

1. Open [the homepage](https://openai.github.io/ai-ml-demos-workshop) or `index.html` in your browser.
2. Choose a demo from the list. Each demo lives in the `demos/` folder.

## Running Notebooks

The `colab-notebooks/` folder contains optional Jupyter notebooks. Click the **Open in Colab** badge at the top of a notebook to run it in Google Colab.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! To add a new demo:

1. Create a new folder inside `demos/` (e.g. `demo2/`).
2. Add an `index.html`, `script.js`, and `style.css` following the existing template.
3. Update `index.html` at the project root with a link to your demo.

Feel free to submit pull requests or open issues with questions.
